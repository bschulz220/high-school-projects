	<p id="story">You float slowly down to the bottom of the ocean. Apparently, trying to light a signal fire on top of your life raft wasn't the greatest of ideas. Luckily your fancy futuristic scuba gear can let you breathe underwater for at least a day, so you might not drown if you can get back to land fast enough. Eventually you land on what appears to be a tower of a castle. Which is weird. There are stairs on the tower leading down into the castle. Explore the castle or try to swim back up?</p>
